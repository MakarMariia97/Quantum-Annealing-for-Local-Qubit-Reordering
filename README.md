# Quantum-Annealing-for-Local-Qubit-Reordering

This repository implements quantum circuit optimization by performing local qubit reordering in 2d (or 1D) NN architecture using Quantum Annealing. The approach is based on \footnote{Wakaki, Hattori & Yamashita, Shigeru. (2019). Mapping a Quantum Circuit to 2D Nearest Neighbor Architecture by Changing the Gate Order. IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems. E102.D. 2127-2134. 10.1587/transinf.2018EDP7439.} The circuit is presented as a set of gates included and dependecies between them. By default, Toffoli gate is optimized. Both Simulated and Quantum Annealing can be used.
